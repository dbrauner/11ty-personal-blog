<p>When I moved from Brazil to Dublin last year, I felt a need to keep connected, not only with my family and friends there, but with development community as well. However, I couldn't actually fill that hole with the social medias I have, I've sort of realized that I was actually feeling more disconnected. I guess that this is no news for anybody nowadays, the fact that social medias drain your life time and feed you with the same type of content and you use as statistics, but I am not here to complain about those, I couldn't entirely get away from them, but I am trying to use this space to contribute a bit and feel that I am making a better use of my spare time.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i%3F">Who am I? <a class="direct-link" href="#who-am-i%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>I should have probably started with that one! I am a father, geek, hobbist guitar player and from 9-5 I am a software engineer for one of those Big-Tech companies, and I must say that althought I will be talking about the services and technologies from the company, everything here is my personal opinion and do not represent the company in any way, all content is based on my experience as a user and developer, not an employee.<br>
Anyway, I want to use this space in a more generic way, I still don't know exactly where this is going, but I want to use this as a kick-start to great things on the Internet!</p>
<h2 id="where-this-is-going">Where this is going <a class="direct-link" href="#where-this-is-going">#</a></h2>
<p>As I said before, no much concrete plan for this website, I have a initial thought of using it talk about nice tools I learned to use, quick tutorials about things I am playing around and some random thoughts about life and its perks! I want to keep it consistent, so it will be probably a bit scrapy and with some mistakes, I want to learn and improve on the way! Maybe some day I will revisit this first words and will laught about it for being so wrong!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-find-me">How to find me <a class="direct-link" href="#how-to-find-me">#</a></h2>
<p>I am not a heavy user of many social medias other than Instagram and Facebook, but I need a way to keep contact with other people from here as well, so you can find me on Twitter by @douglasbrauner, also you can drop me an email at <a href="mailto:dbbrauner@gmail.com">dbbrauner@gmail.com</a>. See ya in the next post!</p>
